# Join Data Check

This python script can be used in conjunction with the [Muscat](https://github.com/IntersectAustralia/muscat) 
application to ensure linking data exists between sources and authorities. It inserts linking data if it doesnâ€™t exist 
in the configured muscat DB join tables.

To use the script simply run python2 on it. For example, `python2 ~/muscat/join_check/join_data_check.py` assuming it 
is located in a directory called `join_check` in the muscat root directory.

The first time the script runs it will create and write to a log file called `join_check.log` which will be appended 
to thereafter.

Before the script can be used it will need to be configured with the credentials of the Muscat application database
and ideally a separate dedicated user. For example,
```
host = "localhost"
user =  "join_check"
pword = "python"
database = "muscat"
```
