# Join Data Check

This python script can be used in conjunction with the [Muscat](https://github.com/IntersectAustralia/muscat) application to ensure linking data exists between sources and authorities. It inserts linking data if it doesnâ€™t exist in the configured muscat DB join tables.

To use the script simply run python2 on it. For example, `python2 ~/muscat/join_check/join_data_check.py` assuming it is located in a directory called `join_check` in the muscat root directory.

The first time the script runs it will create and write to a log file called `join_check.log` which will be appended to thereafter.

Before the script can be used it will need to be configured with the credentials of the Muscat application database and ideally a separate dedicated user. For example,
```
host = "localhost"
database = "database_name"
user = "user_name"
password = "user_password"
``` 

Logging is performed in a file named `join_check.log`. This file is stored in the same directory that the join_check run command is called from. For example, this may either be in the muscat-scripts root directory or the muscat root directory. The log file lists `STARTED_AT` and `COMPLETED_AT` timestamps to aid in identifying a run.
